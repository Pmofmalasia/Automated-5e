Note for Spells: pg 141 - "A magic item may require you to use your own spellcasting ability. If you have more than one (likely valid) ability, choose which one to use. If you don't have one (e.g. Rogue with Use Magic Device), then your ability modifier is +0 and you DO gain your proficiency bonus."
