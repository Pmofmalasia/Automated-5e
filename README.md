# Automated-5e

A framework written for MapTool to automate the rules of Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. The framework can be used simply by downloading the campaign file and running it in MapTool.

A written guide for using the framework can be found in the MapTool discord channel or forum post. There is also a video guide - it's quite long, but has labeled chapters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8VZA1gO2ec

Currently the project is in alpha release - follow updates here or at the MapTool discord!
